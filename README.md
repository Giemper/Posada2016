# Posada Discipulos 2016
Annual Development of a gift exchange party done by a local group of friends every Christmas. The main purpose of the page is not limited to gift matching, as it also allows for each user to register it's preference, and to answer quick surveys about their likes, dislike, and hobbies to help their secret santa.

The webpage allows to set an "incompatibility" parameter to each user, in order to avoid last year repeated Santas, and to, err.. avoid unwanted matches between people. To do so, there are admin accounts that handle the management of the matchmaking system.

The page also features annonymous messaging from Santa to Giftee, polls, profile editing and pleanty of inside jokes.
